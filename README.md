## Manning - liveProject - Scaffold Generator in Go - Static content

We will create two web applications that will be generated by the command-line application.

One version of the code will be for an API backend-only web application. In other words, this will be a web application with no frontend.

The other version will be used to create a website. It will serve HTML, JavaScript, and cascading style sheets (CSS) files. Once you have the web applications ready, you will use Go templates to create a templated version of each.


This project is for the static website one
